        <p>
          The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language
          for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It is often
          assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting
          languages such as JavaScript.

          <h3>CSS</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing
          the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as
          HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
          alongside HTML and JavaScript.

          <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is
          one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
          CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for
          webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.

          <header><h4>No SQL</h4></header>

          <p>
            A NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of
            data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used
            in relational databases. Such databases have existed since the late
            1960s, but the name "NoSQL" was only coined in the early 21st
            century, triggered by the needs of Web 2.0 companies.

          <header><h4>SQL</h4></header>

          <p>
            Structured Query Language, abbreviated as SQL, is a domain-specific
            language used in programming and designed for managing data held in
            a relational database management system, or for stream processing in
            a relational data stream management system.
